This test application allows you to type {\ttfamily ntpdate $<$server$>$} and get the current date + the offset in microseconds of the N\+TP timestamp (seconds from 1900-\/01-\/01) from the current {\ttfamily xtimer\+\_\+now\+\_\+usec64()} back utilizing S\+N\+TP. Make sure that {\ttfamily $<$server$>$} is reachable and has an N\+TP daemon installed.
