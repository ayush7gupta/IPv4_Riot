This tests initializes all on-\/board buttons available, currently up to 4 in total. Each button is configured as an input with interrupt on button press or release depending on the configured T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+F\+L\+A\+NK.

\section*{Expected Result}

When a button is pressed (and/or released) an interrupt fires which results in a message indicating which button was used. The test naturally qualifies for manual testing only. Nevertheless, it prints \char`\"{}\mbox{[}\+S\+U\+C\+C\+E\+S\+S\mbox{]}\char`\"{} after all buttons were initialized successfully or \char`\"{}\mbox{[}\+F\+A\+I\+L\+E\+D\mbox{]} $<$msg$>$\char`\"{} on error, so it can be used for limited automated testing as well.
