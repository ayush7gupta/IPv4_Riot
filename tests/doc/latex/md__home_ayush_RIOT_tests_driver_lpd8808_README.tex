This test application is made for verification of the L\+P\+D8808 L\+ED strip driver.

\section*{Usage}

Connect a L\+P\+D8808 based L\+ED strip to a board of your choice, build, and flash this application. You should see a light running up and down your strip, slowly changing it\textquotesingle{}s color.

You might need to adjust the default parameters (number of L\+E\+Ds on the strip and pin configuration). You can do this simply by pre-\/setting the {\ttfamily C\+F\+L\+A\+GS} environment variable, e.\+g.\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
$ CFLAGS="-DLPD8808\_PARAM\_LED\_CNT=78"" make all
\end{DoxyCode}
