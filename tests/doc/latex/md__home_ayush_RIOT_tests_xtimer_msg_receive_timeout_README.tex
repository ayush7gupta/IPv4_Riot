This test will sequentially start T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+C\+O\+U\+NT xtimers to send a I\+PC msg, alternating with an interval of T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+P\+E\+R\+I\+OD +/-\/ 10\%. Every time a timer was set, it will wait for a message for at most T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+P\+E\+R\+I\+OD microseconds. This should succeed with a message or fail with timeout in an alternating manner.

Default values are T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+C\+O\+U\+NT = 10, and T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+P\+E\+R\+I\+OD = 100ms = 100000us.
