This test will blink all available on-\/board L\+E\+Ds, one after each other in an endless loop. Each L\+ED will light up once long, and twice short, where the long interval is roughly 4 times as long as the short interval. The length of the interval is not specified and differs for each platform.

\section*{Background }

Running this test shows if all the direct access macros for all on-\/board L\+E\+Ds are working correctly (xx\+\_\+\+ON, xx\+\_\+\+O\+FF, xx\+\_\+\+T\+O\+G\+G\+LE). This test is intentionally not using any timers, so it can also be used early on in the porting process, where timers might not yet be available.
