This is a manual test application for the L\+I\+S3\+M\+DL magnetometer driver.

\section*{Usage}

This test application will initialize the accelerometer with the following parameters\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Sampling Rate\+: 10\+Hz
\item Scale\+: 4G
\item Temperature sensor\+: Enabled
\end{DoxyItemize}

After initialization, the sensor reads the magnetometer values every 100ms and prints them to the S\+T\+D\+O\+UT.
