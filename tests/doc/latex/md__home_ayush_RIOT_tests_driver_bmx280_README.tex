This is a test application for the B\+M\+E280 and B\+M\+P280 sensors. Both can measure pressure and temperature. The B\+M\+E280 can also measure relative humidity.

\subsection*{Usage}

The application will initialize the B\+M\+E280/\+B\+M\+P280 device and display its calibration coefficients. More information can be found on the \href{http://www.bosch-sensortec.com/en/bst/products/all_products/bme280}{\tt Bosch website}, in the \href{https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BME280_DS001-11.pdf}{\tt B\+S\+T-\/\+B\+M\+E280\+\_\+\+D\+S001-\/11 datasheet} and in the \href{https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BMP280-DS001-12.pdf}{\tt B\+S\+T-\/\+B\+M\+P280-\/\+D\+S001-\/12 datasheet}.

Notice that it is necessary to first read the temperature even if only one of the other values (humidity or pressure) is needed. This is described in the above mentioned datasheet.

After initialization, every 2 seconds, the application\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item reads and displays the temperature (dÂ°C);
\item reads and displays the pressure (Pa);
\item reads and displays the humidity (rH) (only with bme280);
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Overruling default parameters}

If your device is at a different I2C address than the default (0x77) you can build the test as follows\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}export CFLAGS=-DBME280_PARAM_I2C_ADDR=0x76
BOARD=sodaq-autonomo make -C tests/driver_bmx280
\end{DoxyVerb}


By default, the test application is built to use the bme280 module, to build it for the bmp280, add {\ttfamily D\+R\+I\+V\+ER=bmp280} to the previous command\+:

\begin{DoxyVerb}$ DRIVER=bmp280 BOARD=sodaq-autonomo make -C tests/driver_bmx280
\end{DoxyVerb}
