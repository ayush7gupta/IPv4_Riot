This folder contains a test application for R\+I\+OT\textquotesingle{}s sock-\/based D\+NS client.

\section*{How to test with native}

Setup up a tap interface\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap user $(id -u -n)
$ sudo ip a a 2001:db8::1/64 dev tap0
$ sudo ip link set up dev tap0
\end{DoxyVerb}


Start dnsmasq (in another console)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ sudo dnsmasq -d -2 -z -i tap0 -q --no-resolv \
    --dhcp-range=::1,constructor:tap0,ra-only \
    --listen-address 2001:db8::1 \
    --host-record=example.org,10.0.0.1,2001:db8::1
\end{DoxyVerb}


(Network\+Manager is known to start an interfering dnsmasq instance. It needs to be stopped before this test.)

Then run the test application \begin{DoxyVerb}$ make term
\end{DoxyVerb}


The application will take a little while to auto-\/configure it\textquotesingle{}s IP address. Then you should see something like \begin{DoxyVerb}example.org resolves to 2001:db8::1\end{DoxyVerb}
