This is a manual test application for the L\+P\+S331\+AP pressure sensor driver.

\section*{Usage}

This test application will initialize the pressure sensor with the following parameters\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Sampling Rate\+: 7\+Hz
\end{DoxyItemize}

After initialization, the sensor reads the pressure and temperature values every 250ms and prints them to the S\+T\+D\+O\+UT.
