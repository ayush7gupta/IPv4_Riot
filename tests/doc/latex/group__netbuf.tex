Network buffer descriptor for \hyperlink{group__netconn}{Netconn A\+PI}. Based on \hyperlink{group__pbuf}{Packet buffers (P\+B\+UF)} internally to avoid copying data around.~\newline
Buffers must not be shared accross multiple threads, all functions except netbuf\+\_\+new() and netbuf\+\_\+delete() are not thread-\/safe.
