This is a manual test application for the L3\+G4200D gyroscope driver.

\section*{Usage}

This test application will initialize the pressure sensor with the following parameters\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Sampling Rate\+: 100\+Hz
\item Bandwidth\+: 25\+Hz
\item Scale\+: 500\+D\+PS
\end{DoxyItemize}

After initialization, the sensor reads the angular speed values every 10ms and prints them to the S\+T\+D\+O\+UT.
