This is a manual test application for the M\+A\+G3110 magnetometer driver.

\section*{Usage}

This test application will initialize the M\+A\+G3110 with the following parameters\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item output rate set to 1.\+25 Hz
\item over sample ratio set to 128
\end{DoxyItemize}

After initialization, the sensor reads the x-\/, y-\/, z-\/axis values every 1 s and prints them to S\+T\+D\+O\+UT.
