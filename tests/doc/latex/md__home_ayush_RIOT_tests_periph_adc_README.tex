When running this test, you should see the samples of all configured A\+DC lines continuously streamed to std-\/out.

\section*{Background }

This test application will initialize each configured A\+DC lines to sample with 10-\/bit accuracy. Once configured the application will continuously convert each available channel and print the conversion results to std-\/out.

For verification of the output connect the A\+DC pins to known voltage levels and compare the output.
