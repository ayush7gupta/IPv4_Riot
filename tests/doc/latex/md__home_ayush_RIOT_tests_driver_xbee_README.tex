This is a manual test application for testing the Xbee S1 network device driver.

For running this test, you need to connect the following pins of a Xbee S1 module to your board\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item U\+A\+RT RX
\item U\+A\+RT TX
\item V\+CC (3\+V3)
\item G\+ND
\end{DoxyItemize}

N\+O\+TE\+: when you use an Arduino Xbee shield, the Xbee module is connected to the same U\+A\+RT as R\+I\+O\+Ts standard out. In this case you must redefine U\+A\+R\+T\+\_\+\+S\+T\+D\+I\+O\+\_\+\+D\+EV to another U\+A\+RT interface in the board.\+h and connect a U\+A\+R\+T-\/to-\/\+U\+SB adapter to that U\+A\+RT.

\section*{Usage}

For testing the Xbee driver you can use the netif shell commands that are included in this application.
