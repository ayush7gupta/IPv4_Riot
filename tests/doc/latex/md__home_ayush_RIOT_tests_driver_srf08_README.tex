This is a manual test application for the S\+R\+F08 ultrasonic ranger driver.

\section*{Usage}

After initialization, the sensor values are read periodically and printed to the S\+T\+D\+O\+UT. Here, three echos are stored.

To verify the seen values you can focus the sensor against any reflecting object and vary the distance to see especially the first measured value changing.
