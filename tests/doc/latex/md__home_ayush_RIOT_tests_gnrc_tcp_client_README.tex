This test starts a client using G\+N\+RC T\+CP. The test is intended to work with gnrc\+\_\+tcp\+\_\+server.

On startup the client tries to connect to a server waiting for an incoming connection request. The target address and port number can be user specified during the test build. After successful connection establishment, the clients sends 2048 byte containing a test pattern (0x\+F0) to the peer. After successful transmission, the client expects to receive 2048 byte with a test pattern (0x\+A7) from the peer. After successful verification, the connection termination sequence is initiated.

The test sequence above runs a configurable amount of times.
