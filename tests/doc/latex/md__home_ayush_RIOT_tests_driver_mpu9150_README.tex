This is a test application for the M\+P\+U-\/9150 Nine-\/\+Axis Driver.

\section*{Usage}

The application will initialize the M\+P\+U-\/9150 motion sensor with the following parameters\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Accelerometer\+: ON
\item Gyroscope\+: ON
\item Magnetometer\+: ON
\item Sampling Rate\+: 200\+Hz
\item Compass Sampling Rate\+: 100\+Hz
\end{DoxyItemize}

After initialization, the application reads accel, gyro, compass and temperature values every second and prints them to the S\+T\+D\+O\+UT.
