This test application is polling all available S\+A\+UL devices periodically for their data. This data is then printed to S\+T\+D\+IO.

\section*{Background }

The actual devices that are actually polled depend on the devices that are configured for a particular platform. If you want to test the S\+A\+UL interface to a particular device, you should just connect it to your B\+O\+A\+RD and include the corresponding device driver using the {\ttfamily U\+S\+E\+M\+O\+D\+U\+LE} environment variable.
