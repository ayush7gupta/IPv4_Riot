This is a manual test application for the A\+D\+T7310 temperature sensor driver.

\section*{Usage}

This test application will initialize the sensor with the following parameters\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Mode\+: 1 S\+PS
\item Resolution\+: 16 bit
\end{DoxyItemize}

After initialization, the sensor reads the acceleration values every second and prints them to the S\+T\+D\+O\+UT.
