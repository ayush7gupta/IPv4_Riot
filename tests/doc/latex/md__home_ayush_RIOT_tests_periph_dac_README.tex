This is a test application for a digital to analog converter (D\+AC).

This test application tries to initialize every available D\+AC line. If successful, it will output a saw tooth pattern with a period of about 10\+Hz on each of the available lines.

\section*{Usage }

Connect an oscilloscope to the D\+AC pins and look at the signal levels (you should be able to clearly see the saw tooth signal in your scope)
