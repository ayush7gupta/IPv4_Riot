This test starts a server using G\+N\+RC T\+CP. The test is intended to work with gnrc\+\_\+tcp\+\_\+client.

On startup the server assigns a given I\+P-\/\+Address to its network interface and opens a given port number waiting for a client to connect to this port. As soon as a client connects the server expects to receive 2048 byte containing a sequence of a test pattern (0x\+F0).

After successful verification, the server sends 2048 byte with a test pattern (0x\+A7) to the peer. After successful transmission the connection termination sequence is initiated.

The test sequence above runs a configurable amount of times.
