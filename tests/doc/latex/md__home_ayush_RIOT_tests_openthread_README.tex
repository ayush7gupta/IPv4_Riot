This test demonstrates the \href{https://github.com/openthread/openthread}{\tt Open\+Thread} stack running on R\+I\+OT. When flashed, it will initialize the Open\+Thread Command Line Interface for interacting with the stack.

\subsection*{Quick usage}

To test Open\+Thread on R\+I\+OT, you can do the following\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Flash nodes with {\ttfamily make B\+O\+A\+RD=$<$target$>$ clean all flash}
\item Write {\ttfamily panid 0x1234}, {\ttfamily ifconfig up} then {\ttfamily thread start} on one node.
\item Check the state of the node with {\ttfamily state}. In the beggining should be {\ttfamily detached}, but after some seconds it should become {\ttfamily leader}
\item Write {\ttfamily panid 0x1234}, {\ttfamily ifconfig up} then {\ttfamily thread start} on another node. The second node should become {\ttfamily child} or {\ttfamily router} if there\textquotesingle{}s a leader.
\item Get the mesh IP address of a node with {\ttfamily ipaddr}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}
 ipaddr
fdde:ad00:beef::ff:fe00:8000
fe80::ff:fe00:8000
fdde:ad00:beef:0:946a:c722:a5d9:8481
fe80::3984:f4eb:d182:5dae
\end{DoxyCode}


Addresses starting with {\ttfamily fd} are mesh-\/local, and addresses starting with {\ttfamily fe80} are link-\/local. Mesh-\/local address types that contain {\ttfamily ff\+:fe00} are classified as Router Locator (R\+L\+OC). Mesh-\/local address types that don\textquotesingle{}t contain {\ttfamily ff\+:fe00} are Endpoint Identifies (E\+ID).
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Ping from another node to a mesh-\/local address with {\ttfamily ping fdde\+:ad00\+:beef\+:0\+:946a\+:c722\+:a5d9\+:8481}.
\item You can try I\+E\+E\+E802.\+15.\+4 scan with {\ttfamily scan} command
\item You can also check other commands with {\ttfamily help}
\item Enjoy!
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
