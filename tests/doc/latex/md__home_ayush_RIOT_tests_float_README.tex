This application should infinitely print \textquotesingle{}-\/\textquotesingle{} characters. If it prints only a single \textquotesingle{}+\textquotesingle{} characters the test must be considered as failed.

\section*{Background }

This test was introduced due to an error for floating point handling in an older newlib version.

The idea for this test is taken from\+: \href{http://sourceware.org/ml/newlib/2010/msg00149.html}{\tt http\+://sourceware.\+org/ml/newlib/2010/msg00149.\+html}
