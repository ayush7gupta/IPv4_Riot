This test is largely based on the \href{https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/examples/gnrc_networking}{\tt {\ttfamily gnrc\+\_\+networking}} example but uses a modified {\ttfamily udp} command\+: Instead of providing data in a string format a number of bytes is given. A packet of that size is then send, its content consisting of an incrementing repeating byte. The server is also modified as it outputs the number of currently received packets when a new packet is received instead of the content of the new packet. This counter can be reset using {\ttfamily udp reset}
